## Core Principle: Map, Not Territory

The repo holds the **map**, not the territory. Projects have resources that live in external systems:

- **chat** - Slack, Discord, Telegram...
- **tasks** - GitHub Issues, Taiga, Linear...
- **code** - GitHub repos (often multiple)
- **payments/milestones** - Taiga, Notion, spreadsheets...
- **deployments** - demo, staging, production URLs
- **docs** - Google Drive, Notion, or this repo

Each project's MAIN.md points to where these live. The actual state (open tasks, recent messages, deploy status) lives in those systems. This repo holds:

- Goals, vision, intent (the "why")
- The map of where everything is (the "where")
- Context that helps humans and AI navigate (the "how")

Don't duplicate data that lives elsewhere. Point to it.
