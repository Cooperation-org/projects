## Project Notes (optional)

### Current Focus: Scheduling

Biggest pain points identified:
1. Verifying Hours
2. Scheduling (cancellations, new calls)

Starting with shift cancellation & reassignment system.

### Slack Implementation

Recommendation: Start with DM-based approach for targeted outreach, later add channel notifications for critical unfilled shifts.
